# Lab Report: Letterpress I: Composition

#### Lilly Wilcox

## Process Description

In this lab, I learned how to create the block of type that would be used to print in our class' book of twitterbot poetry. I decided to typeset the piece of poetry, "to cry on a vintage sofa while other people are drinking coffee is not so rough unless it happens to you" because I loved the sense of drama it communicated. I knew that I had a longer piece of poetry and wanted make sure that it would fit, so I chose 18 point Century Expanded. Working with smaller type was a challenge, but as I moved down the lines, I got more comfortable with the pieces, and luckily, I didn't drop anything. By the end of the process, I had memorized where a number of the letters were in the drawer. I was suprised that I was able to get into a rhythm, and I found the process of typesetting to be really fun. I finished setting my lines by the end of the class period and was proud of my progress.

## Observations

One thing that I was really excited about when I was working on my composition is that I was able to use the "ff" ligature in the word "coffee." I've skimmed the wikipedia page on ligatures, which classifies ligatures starting with the letter "f" as stylistic, rather than practical. However, these types of ligatures were created because the lowercase "f" sort usually had a kern, where the letter extended past the block of metal it was on, so it was easily damaged by the following letter.  When looking into this I learned that the term "kerning," which I had previously known as a digital design term, comes from printing.

The amount of time it took for me to set a small block of type caused me to think about literacy as a whole, when the printing press was the most efficient way to disseminate information. So many people remained illiterate when the printing press was the primary means of the dissemination of information. Not only was printed material expensive, it took time to print, which restricted bredth and depth. I had considered that printing was an entrepreneurial endeavor marked by its materials, but until partaking in composition myself, I never thought of time as an economic comodity. Once text is composed copies can be printed relatively quickly, but the composition of the text itself is a huge task. 

## Analysis

The final sentence in the Borsuk chapter, "The Book as Content" resonated with me while completing and reflecting on this lab. 

>Borsuk writes, "Even though innumerable material elements come together to make the book, these features have been naturalized to such a degree that we now hardly notice them, since we have come to see content as the copyrightable, consumable, marketable aspect of the work."

I chose my bit of poetry from a copy of *The Essential Bukowski* that I bought at Barnes and Noble during the holiday season. Normally I wouldn't think too much about this, but this lab forced me to consider that purchase and think about all of the pieces of the process that led to me finding the poem I chose. The commercialization of books led to the creation of chain bookstores, liek the Barnes and Noble I went to, and the mass production of books themselves. There also had to be a specific market for poetry books; someone had to decide which poems would fill the book I chose, so that it would be chosen by the consumer. These processes, among others, made my specific copy of *The Essential Bukowski* accesssible. Without the creation of the system of printing, which lead to the commericalization of books as both objects and as content, I would not have found this poem, and my composition might have been very different. 

When composing my poem, I was forced to view the individual letters as part of a system. The different pieces of type created words and sentences, of course, and all of this together created a font. The font did not depend on the content, but rather, it depended on the literal appearance of the words and sentences. It is clear that different fonts have different affects, and when chosing what font to use for my piece, I considered the Gayomali article. Different fonts - even two different serif fonts - communicate different things. Borsuk backs this up when he explains that humanists prefered roman or italic typefaces that reflected human handwriting. As a result, those types of fonts communicated a sense of intellect. 

Again, I can't help but think about the history that influences modern reading, in this case, through font choice. Different fonts developed as individual systems within the larger system of printing. The font category has broadened, but the readers' feeling about fonts has remained relatively consistent through time. The frequency of publishing in serif fonts was largely defined by an arbitrary choice of an Italian humanist printer who preferred the academic feel of what became the modern serif font style. 

So many processes came together to create our modern reading experience, including the development of fonts and the commercialization of books. This lab forced me to consider these processes individually and as parts of a larger system of literacy.
