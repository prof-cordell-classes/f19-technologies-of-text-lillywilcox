# Lab Report: Github & Markdown

#### Lilly Wilcox

## Process Description

In this lab, I learned how to use Github and Markdown to submit assignments for class. I was a bit lost when we started, unsure of what links on the class website would get me to the class Github, but through trial and error and looking over shoulders, I figured out how to access the class Github. From there, the actual downloading was pretty straight forward. I am using Github for desktop and learned how to commit files to the master, so that I could submit my homework for Monday. 

I downloaded MacDown to edit markdown files because I found it difficult to read and visualize text using TextEdit on my Mac. I made copies of different files and began to format this lab report and my reading prep. After I became comfortable with using the two softwares and familiarized myself with the text formatting of markdown files, I looked into the formation and history of markdown on Wikipedia. I find it interesting that Markdown has grown beyond the file type because of its transferability and that  people have developed many different platforms so that they can use markdown. 

## Observations

Personally, I find the font of the markdown text difficult to read. One of the design goals, according to its Wikipedia, but I believe this refers to readability by different platforms, not by humans; however, the language is moderately technical, and I am not sure if I completely understand the implications of the word "readable" in sentence. 

The markdown font is curiously in between serif and sans serif. Most letters are sans, but "i/I," "l," and "t" stood out to me because they break that pattern (at least as they appear in TextEdit and MacDown). Someone had to make that design choice for plain text writing at some point, and I cannot figure out who or why this happened. Generally I prefer sans serif fonts, but I have coped to work with Times New Roman because of the preference of many teachers. I am not used to seeing a font that seems so technical, but I believe that I will adjust in a similar way to markdown text by the end of the sememster. 

I like using MacDown because I can check my text in the second window in a sans serif font, and in a more traditional format. I think it is really cool to that Macdown can translate plain text formatting to rich text formatting in real time. Rich text files are so commonplace that I had never considered what was happening behind the scenes 

## Analysis

One of the affordances of Github that we discussed is that it allows the author to track and view histories of a file. I think this feature addresses some of the problems with writing that Socrates claims. Because one can view changes and history the piece of text becomes more discursive, if only with itself. One can see the development of the author's ideas through the ways that the file develops accross different save points. While Socrates could not have an argument with a file in Github, he would prefer it to seeing only the final manuscript because of its semi-discursive element. 

The prevalance of markdown itself shows that we recognize the affordances of plain text, an older and simpler medium. However, the prevalance of rich text formats does not induce us to having the same conversations about the end of literacy that reading in a digital age has. We seem more open to the coexistance of plain text and rich text, than we are to the coexistance of codecies and e-books. In theory, I think the same argument should be happening about the two sets of media, but between rich text and plain text, two digital media, the differences seem less drastic. We should start thinking about codecies and e-books in the way that we think about rich text and plain text; they are two sides of the same coin.

Price's argument about the silliness of the fear of the decline of literacy seems to be right, and media like Github and markdown are just new media through which we value literacy. Price's claim of "the myth of exceptionalism," which describes the phenomenon that we always believe that we are living through unpredecedented change, resonated with me during this lab (8). I think that change is built upon other change, and therefore, no change can be unprecedented. Rich text could not have come about without plain text. We cannot and should not believe that technological developments that we see firsthand mean more than the foundations on which they were built.
