## Questions or Observations

1. I like how the anti-poetry theme continues throughout the graphic novel, until the very end. Describing a very logical, mathematical process in a creative way pushes against convention and seems to be represented by the arrival of Sir William Rowan Hamilton towards the conclusion of the reading. 
2. I enjoyed the use of footnotes throughout the reading. While I think they made the graphic novel element less coherent, I liked the context they provided to a whimsical story. Towards the beginning of the reading, I was frustrated by them, but I think it was important that the information was included and I would be less likely to take in that information to comprehend the story if Padua used only endnotes. 
3. One visual piece that I liked was the use of different fonts within the illustration to communicate different tones. When the author on page 159 speaks in a serif font, he is distinguished as a self-important and somewhat obnoxious individual. I recalled the reading we did earlier in the semester that discussed the different grades given to papers written in Arial, Georgia, and Times New Roman.
