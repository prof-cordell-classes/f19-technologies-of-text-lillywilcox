# Reading Prep: Circuit

## Questions or Observations

1. One thing I remember about the earlier editions of the Kindle is the advertisements. I think this ad was mentioned in another reading we've done in class, but I remember the ad for the Kindle Paperwhite, which claimed superiority over the iPad because it combatted glare in the sun. Despite this Ad campaign, Amazon developed the Kindle Fire to compete with the iPad, which presented the same glare problems they bragged about earlier. Andersen seems to argue that e-book reading has fallen out of fashion because it has failed to develop, but in this case it seems like e-book reading got worse because it was forced to develop. While this case seems like the exception to the rule, it is interesting to consider the hindrances of development as well as the successes. 
2. One thing that is curious about What Will Football Look Like in the Future is that it was a serialized piece. I recall talking about how novels used to be serialized pieces, which impacted the way they were both written and read. One glaring difference between old novel and this piece is the media used. What are the affordances and limitations of reading a multimedia piece in a continuous manner? How might the media impact its serialization?
3. One quote that I really like is from Intermission, part 2. 

"If they advanced too much futher technologically, those advances would inevitably intrude on their humanity. People wanted to walk. They wanted to take the bus that smelled like cigarettes. They wanted those precious three minutes between asking a question and knowing the answer."

It's interesting to think about this quote in contrast to the Andersen reading, considering his argument that e-book reading is failing because of complacency. This reading, however, imagines a world where humanity got so far beyond complacency that it was forced to return. Personally, I buy the *Football* argument more. I am definitely afraid that "assistive technology" will take away from the humanness of our daily lives.
