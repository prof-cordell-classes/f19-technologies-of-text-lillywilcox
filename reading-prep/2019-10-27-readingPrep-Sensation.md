# Reading Prep: Sensation

## Questions or Observations

1. It's interesting that Uzanne imagines a reversion to a aural society because of the phonograph. In the future, all things will be recorded and listened to, which makes me think of the tradition of listening to poems before the invention of books. I also can't help but think of the rise of podcasting, and that there is some truth to Uzanne's prediction. The note about journalism stood out to me because I do get so much of my news from various podcasts. This piece was fun to read because of the narrator's excitement and the relative accuracy of his predictions. 
2. This quote from the Hendren piece stood out to me:
"After all, how cultures define, think about, and treat those who currently have marked disabilities is how all their future citizens may be perceived if and when those who are able-bodied become less abled than they are now, whether by age, degeneration, or some sudden or gradual change in physical or mental capacities." 
This is a really interesting argument from a piece that challeneged by own understanding of disability. The amount of respect and shame assigned to people born disabled and people who become disabled is significant. I wonder if there are systemic ways in which this difference is enforced beyond the creation of "assistive technology."
3. The question that remains for me after the Universal Page piece is about the way that punctuation works in Braille writing. I know that punctuation varies accross alphabets and accross languages, but all I can properly imagine is the small marks that we pair with the roman alphabet. I assume that this wouldn't work with Braille writing because it would be easily conufsed with the letters themselves. I also wonder how Braille/blind reading is changing with the prevalance of computers. Is listening becoming more popular because of this?
