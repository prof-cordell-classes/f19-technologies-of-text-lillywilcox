## Questions or Observations

1. How has the relationship between reading/writing and social/political resistance developed over time? This is a central question of the Cushman reading, but Borsuk also talked about how Blake used his works to push back against child labor, slavery, and other topics. When is the first occurance of literacy as a political tool?
2. Mak states "As will become evident in the next chapters, Buonaccorsoâ€™s treatise continues to be reincarnated in diferent guises for diferent audiences," which reminded me of the Dinius' piece on David Walker's Appeal. The manipulation of meaning through visual editing seems to prevalent and effective. What are the motivations of printers/editors who make these changes? 
3. One thing that I've always wondered about, concerning dictionaries, is whether it is even useful to try to use language to describe many nouns. I've always thought that it would be easier to understand many nouns through images. Cawdrey ran into a problem with nouns, and decided to mark words with the letter "k" when they are too specific to be defined. In these cases, I think that showing an image of a crocodile would be easier than simply calling it a "beast." This wouldn't be doable for Cawdrey of course, but in modern dictionaries, I personally feel like images would be more helpful than words to teach meaning.
