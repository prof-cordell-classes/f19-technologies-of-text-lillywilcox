# Reading Prep: Preface

#### Lilly Wilcox

## Questions or Observations

1. 1. Is there a benefit to “ceding agency” to media, a practice that Gitelman critiques? Is it more helpful to study the physical media in addition to the way it shaped society? Is there a disagreement between Gitelman and Price here?
2. In the Introduction of What We Talk About When We Talk About Books, Price discusses the decline in the use of eBooks since 2016. I have the Kindle version of the book, which seems to have been made specifically as an eBook — there are no page numbers, only location numbers. Is there an irony in this? What might motivate a publisher to design a book specifically for digital release?
3. As a book historian, Price values the story of past as told by the physical copy of the book. Based on this, what would she, as a literary scholar, think of the idea of the Death of the Author? Interpreting a physical book in the context of its time, and interpreting the writing of a book in the context of its time seem to be two sides of the same coin.
