## Questions or Observations

1. In Trithemius’ In Praise of Scribes, he speaks to the importance of scribes to the Church. Without them Scripture would be corrupted or lost, and “the peace of Catholic unity would be a roil of confusion.” Based on this, I am wondering what the differences are in practice between religions that are dependent on written texts, and religions with stronger oral traditions, beyond the obvious answers. Is religion with a stronger oral tradition more malleable in what it preaches? Are people any less devout? Are there differences in taught values?
2. One thing that I found really interesting is the link between the printing press and the church. It makes sense that Gutenberg wanted to print the Bible - the church was powerful and would be in the market for bibles. I wonder if the printing press ended up contributing to power of the church in the end. Both The Book and the documentary mentioned that indulgences were mass produced on the printing press, which made the church more money. In general, how does technology play into the hands of systems of power?
3. Another thing from the book that surprised me was that Gutenberg used technologies that already existed to create the press, and that he did not invent moveable type. All of my knowledge, especially around rare books, is very Euro-centric, and learning that moveable type was invented in China in 1041 was an important reminder to look beyond what I am academically familiar with.
