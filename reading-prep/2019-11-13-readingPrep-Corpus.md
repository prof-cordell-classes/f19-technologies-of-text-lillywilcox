## Questions or Observations

1. When considering the concept of network authorship, I wonder how printing of the same passage varies regionally. If one text was passed from one big city to another, I would assume that smaller newspapers would only get a hold of the text from their regional capital. The same text could travel very differently in different parts of the country. I'm reflecting on an disagreement I had with some friends last year about the rhyme: "You get what you get and you don't throw a fit/you don't get upset," which was changed based on our home region. I am curious if the difference in sayings like this relate at all to my musing about regional network authorship.
2. The poem "A Literary Curiousity" from the Fugitive Verses list is interesting to consider because the author of a poem is acting as an editor. Not only does the poems original form depend on the system of reprinting, but also the out-of-context words of the different authors that make up the poem. Its almost as if this poem itself is a mini representation of the system of reprinting poems in newspapers. The poem could be subject to many of the patterns seen in the greater system.
3. The reading from *Data Femininsm* introduced completely new ideas to me. I generally don't think about data at all, let alone in the context of social change and feminism. I was convinced by the reading though. What I found most interesting was the point about TSA screenings and the sorting of bodies. I had no idea that when I go through airport security, I am automatically sorted into a binary sex category. To use biological data variation to recognize potential threats seems like it would collect more false information than true information.
