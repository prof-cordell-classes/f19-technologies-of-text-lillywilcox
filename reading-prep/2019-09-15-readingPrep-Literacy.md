## Questions or Observations

1. How does language enable us to be moral people? Does language shape morality? 
2. I find it really fascinating how writing and language has been shaped out of practicality and convenience. (i.e. How writing vertically in Chinese happened because the width of jiance could only fit one character per line). What other examples that persist to this day? How is this happening with language now?
3. How has imperialism hindered and benefitted writing? (I am thinking of the examples of the outlawing of the khipu, versus the spread of paper due to the spread of the Islamic empire.)
